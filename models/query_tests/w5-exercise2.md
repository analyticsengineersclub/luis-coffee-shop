### Exercise 2

#### Write a query and test the timing of how long it takes the query to run under different conditions.
-  When the relation is a view
- When the relation is a table
- Is there a difference between the first and second time a query is run? (I.e., is the database doing some caching for you?)

**Table Materialization**
Query complete (0.4 sec elapsed, 80 B processed)

**View Materialization**
Query complete (1.5 sec elapsed, 8.4 MB processed)
